## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between the unemployment rate and GDP growth in the USA from 2018 to 2023, highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment. The dataset is synthetic and demonstrates various data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of unemployment trends
- Correlation analysis between GDP growth and unemployment rate
- Highlighting the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Year`: The year of observation
- `Country`: The country (USA)
- `Unemployment Rate (%)`: The percentage of unemployed individuals
- `GDP Growth Rate (%)`: The GDP growth rate for the given year
- `COVID Impact`: A binary indicator (1 if COVID impacted unemployment, 0 otherwise)
